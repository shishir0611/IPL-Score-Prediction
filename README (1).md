# IPL-Score-Prediction
```
To predict the first innings score of a match using Machine Learning

One of the most exciting outdoor games that reached everyone's heart is cricket.
This project specifically concentrates on
enactment and measuring the difference between the models to foretell the
captivating teams of an IPL match.
```
## Features

Usage of ML algorithms: 
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbour
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Adaboost 

## Deployment

**Importing libraries**:
- Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Scikit, Matplot

**Download dataset- IPL.csv**

**Exploring Datasets**:



- Data types, columns, etc

**Data Cleaning**:

• Removing unwanted columns

• Keeping only consistent teams

• Removing the first 5 overs data in every match

• Converting the column 'date' from string into datetime object


**Data Preprocessing**: 

• Handling categorical features

• Splitting dataset into train and test set on the basis of date


**Model Building**:

• Linear Regression

• Decision Tree Regression

• Random Forest Regression

• Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) Algorithm

**Predictions**:

• Model trained on the given dataset


## Usage

```
Data is accessed by the computer programs developed using Machine learning to
build models. The algorithm first analyses the data to create a model, specifically for
understanding the patterns or trends. For creating the mining model, the model is
optimised by selecting parameters and iterating. To extract actionable patterns and
detailed statistics, the parameters are then fed into the dataset. This work focuses on
finding meaningful information about the IPL Teams by using the functions of the R
Package
